## Assignment 1
   1. Load the content of the memory location 2200H and 2201 H into registers. Add these registers and store the result in the memory locations 2202H and 2203H.
   2. Find the sum of N numbers stored in consecutive locations starting from 2500H. The value of N is stored in 2200H. Store the result in locations 2300H and 2301H.
   3. Find the sum of least significant 4 bits and most significant 4 bits of a byte stored in memory location 2500H. Store the result in 2550H.
   4. Write a program to count the 1’s and 0’s of a byte stored in 2500H. Store the result in 2610h & 2511h respectively.
   5. Write a program to sum two 16 –bits binary number.
